In this project, we addressed a binary classification problem using a dataset derived from the UCI "Bank Marketing" dataset. The goal was to predict whether a client would subscribe to a term deposit based on various socio-economic and marketing features. We preprocessed the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables, followed by the implementation of a RandomForestClassifier for training the model. The model achieved a satisfactory performance with good accuracy , as evaluated on a test set. The classification report and confusion matrix provided insights into the model's precision, recall, and overall effectiveness in predicting the desired outcome. This project showcases the application of machine learning techniques in the context of banking telemarketing, with potential implications for optimizing marketing strategies.
